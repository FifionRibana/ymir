# ADR 0001 — Erosion: coastal sediment sink, and the terrace / dendritic-valley findings

Status: accepted (2026-08). Scope: C1 HD relief (erosion, FBM upscale, isostasy).
Diagnostic harness: `crates/ymir-core/tests/terrace_diagnosis.rs` (all `#[ignore]`),
commits `019113f`, `76ae09f`, `94fe11b`. Re-run:
`cargo test -p ymir-core --test terrace_diagnosis --release -- --ignored --nocapture`.

This ADR records findings from a measurement campaign on why the C1 HD relief showed
(a) terraces following isolines and (b) no carved dendritic valleys under a
fully-computed river network. Each is stated with the numbers, because the
conclusions are counter-intuitive and will otherwise be re-litigated.

## Decision summary (read this first)

- **Droplet hydraulic erosion is REMOVED from the C1 HD pipeline**, not merely
  reduced. It DESTROYS relief (drainage relief 258→37 m; 659→124 m even at a weak
  0.25 droplets/cell) — it deposits in channels faster than it incises. It is the
  common cause of the terraces (depositional flats), the missing valleys, the
  net-zero mass balance and the coastal sediment dump. See Findings 3–4.
- **Routed stream-power incision (Braun & Willett) + a hillslope REGIME SPLIT is the
  replacement.** Recommended: `K=3, m=0.5, n=1, iterations=3, A_c≈50 cells,
  diffusion≈0.05` (diffusion on hillslopes `A<A_c`, stream power on channels
  `A≥A_c`), θ=0, droplets off, **UNCOUPLED vertical scale** (do NOT couple
  depth_scale to domain). Off by default until confirmed at 8192².
- **θ (incision threshold) and A_c (critical area) each FAILED ALONE** — record this
  so the cheap options are not retried. Only the coupled regime split fixed the
  headwater over-carving AND opened valley cross-sections. See Finding 3.
- **The acceptance CRITERION is a LEGIBLE landscape** — buildable valley floors +
  sharply-delimited steep flanks + moderate interfluves — **NOT minimal steep
  ground.** An earlier "minimise unbuildable land / keep >45° under ~5 %" framing was
  WRONG and cost a pass: steep ground is gameplay content (cliffs, passes, terracing
  constraints). Judge on spatial structure (valley-floor area, cliff-transition
  sharpness, flank contiguity), not a global steep-%. This is why the UNCOUPLED case
  (steeper, more legible flanks) is preferred over the coupled one (too flat).

## Finding 1 — Low `target_land_fraction` is the WRONG lever for a border-clean island

**Context.** The intuitive way to "get an island" is to reduce the land fraction
(raise the ocean) via `target_land_fraction` (tlf) quantile calibration. It is
appealing enough that it will be retried.

**Measurement.** tlf calibration subtracts the `1−f` quantile, which moves SEA LEVEL
onto the flat continental-shelf plateau. Local hypsometric slope at the chosen sea
level (cells per raw-altitude unit; low = flat plateau = hypersensitive coastline):

| sea level | hypsometric slope | coastline |
|---|---|---|
| isostatic (tlf None) | ~12 350 | crisp |
| tlf 0.29 | ~43 950 | crisp (but big continent) |
| **tlf 0.08** | **~2 000** | **speckled — sea on the flat shelf** |

**Decision.** Do NOT use low tlf to make an island. Default is `tlf = None`
(isostatic sea level). Bound the landmass geometrically (seed selection / framing),
not by drowning it. See the domain-as-map seed verdict (`land_topology.rs`).

**Consequences.** Speckled coasts and marginal land avoided; islands come from
seed geometry + the framing roll, at the isostatic sea level.

## Finding 2 — The coastal deposition dump was the net-zero balance lock

**Context.** Hydraulic erosion moved mass but the net balance was ~0 (author's
8192² run: eroded 428 331 / deposited 424 747 ≈ +0.8 %), so the field was barely
reshaped. Suspected cause: sediment redeposited before leaving the domain.

**Measurement.** `hydraulic.rs` terminal coastal path: when a droplet crosses
`sea_level`, after `coastal_deposition_range` (=12) sub-sea steps it **deposited its
entire remaining load at the shoreline**. On the reference field, deposition
concentrated at the coast: **73 % ≤5 cells, 85 % ≤20 cells** from the coastline. M1's
`sea_level` 0.1→0.5 moved that dump onto the true coastline. On the real coarse→FBM
field the terminal dump dominated the balance: sink fraction f=1.0 → **net +1 %**,
f=0.0 → **net +59 %**.

**Decision.** Add `ErosionConfig.coastal_deposit_fraction` (a partial sea SINK):
deposit `f` of the terminal load, discard `1−f` (still counted as eroded). Ship
**f = 0.25** by default: net **+1 % → +47 %** (clearly erosive), deltas/beaches
preserved (deposition ≤5 cells ~47 % vs 24 % at f=0, so the coast is not abrupt),
network hierarchy preserved (maxStrahler 6; droplet density 4/cell would collapse it
to 3 — see Finding 3), emerged fraction drops only ~1 point (23.7 % → 22.7 %). Droplet
density stays 0.95/cell. The field is `skip_serializing_if` at 1.0, so a config
explicitly set to 1.0 reuses the pre-sink cache; the new 0.25 default DOES enter the
eroded cache key and correctly rebuilds derived stages.

**Consequences.** Every existing map's terrain changes (intended cache
invalidation). The mass-balance / coastal-deposit artifact is fixed. This does NOT
carve valleys — see Finding 3.

---

## Finding 3 — Droplet erosion cannot make a dendritic network here (algorithm limit, not tuning)

**Context.** Ymir computes a full drainage network (`rivers.json`, Strahler orders,
`flow_accumulation`), but the relief under the rivers shows no carved valley.

**⚠️ METRIC CORRECTION.** This finding was first measured with a WRONG metric:
"fraction of top-1 % flow cells in a local altitude minimum" (reported as 15 % in
production, ~11 % here). That measures **PITS, not channels** — a drained channel
cell is by construction HIGHER than its downstream receiver, so it is never a local
minimum; only an undrained depression is. Its interpretation was therefore INVERTED
(a low value is *good* drainage, not "uncarved terrain"). The correct quantity is
**drainage relief** = median over top-1 % flow cells of (11×11 window-max − cell), in
metres — how deep channels sit below their interfluves. See the prototype table below
for the real numbers; the pit table is kept only to show what was refuted.

**Pit-fraction table (mislabelled "carved" — the refuted metric; low = fewer pits):**

| f | droplets/cell | net % | pit-fraction | maxStrahler | confluences |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1.0 | 0.95 | +1 | 11 % | 6 | 2366 |
| 0.0 | 0.95 | +59 | 11 % | 6 | 2183 |
| 0.25 | 4.0 | +76 | 18 % | **3** | 649 |
| 0.0 | 4.0 | +87 | 17 % | **3** | 556 |

More droplets raise the pit-fraction to ~18 % only by fragmenting the network
(maxStrahler 6→3, confluences 2366→649 — grain, not drainage). On a synthetic smooth
cone at production parameters, surface roughness barely changed (0.00005 → 0.00006):
no reshaping even on an ideal input.

**THE CENTRAL FINDING (drainage relief, the correct metric).** The production droplet
pass does not sculpt relief — it DESTROYS it: drainage relief **258 m → 37 m (−86 %)**.
Stream-power along the existing network RAISES it to **323 m (+25 %)** at ~13× the
speed. We are not swapping one algorithm for a better one — we are removing something
actively HARMFUL. This single mechanism explains all four symptoms of this ADR: the
terraces (Finding 4 — depositional flats), the missing valleys (this finding), the
net-zero balance and the coastal dump (Finding 2 — the droplets that reach the coast
carry the sediment they refuse to incise with).

**Root cause.** Droplets are stochastic and UNCORRELATED — nothing makes neighbouring
rills converge into a shared, deepening channel; they deposit in and around channels
faster than they incise, so relief collapses and a hierarchical valley network cannot
emerge.

**Decision / proposed successor (NOT implemented).** Routed **stream-power incision**
along the drainage network that is already computed (`flow_accumulation`, `rivers.json`
with Strahler orders and upstream/downstream topology) — deterministic and global, so
hierarchy is imposed by construction. Two pitfalls for whoever implements it:
1. stream-power incision MODIFIES the terrain, so drainage computed beforehand goes
   stale — either iterate drainage↔incision a few times, or accept a single pass;
2. it should COMPLEMENT droplet erosion (stream-power for valleys, droplets for
   hillslope texture), not replace it.

**Consequences.** The missing-valleys problem is out of scope for parameter tuning
and is a separate chantier. The sink (Finding 2) fixes the balance/coast, not this.

**Prototype results (measured, `erosion/stream_power.rs`, off by default).** Braun &
Willett implicit scheme, real coarse→FBM field (1024²), using **drainage relief** =
median (11×11 window-max − cell) over top-1 % flow cells, in metres — the correct
incision metric. (The earlier "carved% / local-minimum fraction" was WRONG: a drained
channel cell is higher than its downstream receiver, so it is NOT a local minimum; the
local-minimum fraction measures PITS, not incision, and its sign is inverted.)

| config | drainage relief | vs FBM | notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| FBM baseline | 258 m | — | |
| **stream-power alone** (K=1,m=.5,n=1,dt=1,iters=3) | **323 m** | **+65** | carves; maxStrahler not fragmented (4); ~554 ms |
| stream-power + diffusion D=0.4 | 230 m | −28 | D=0.4 OVER-smooths |
| droplets alone (production) | 37 m | **−221** | droplets COLLAPSE relief (~7270 ms) |
| both (SP then full droplets) | 24 m | −234 | droplets ERASE the SP valleys |

Findings: stream-power **carves** (+25 % relief) and is **~13× faster** (554 ms vs
7270 ms at 1024²); drainage↔incision **converges by iteration 2** (use N=2–3); K=1/dt=1
calibrated to ~307 m median channel incision (a plausible valley depth, not tuned for
looks). Crucially, **the production droplet pass is anti-incision** — it collapses
drainage relief 258→37 m, the SAME deposition mechanism as the Finding-4 terraces — so
droplets are the common cause of both symptoms. Coupling therefore cannot keep the
full droplet pass; droplets must be reduced to a WEAK hillslope-texture pass (or
dropped) so they don't erase the channels. Diffusion at 0.4 over-smooths; start near 0.

**Hillslope regime (why pure stream power over-carves, and the fix).** Pure stream
power is DETACHMENT-LIMITED WITH NO THRESHOLD — `E = K·A^m·S^n > 0` for any `A > 0`,
so even a near-zero-area cell incises in proportion to its slope; headwaters are the
steepest cells, so they over-carve. Physically those are HILLSLOPES (diffusion /
mass-wasting), not channels — the fluvial law is applied where it does not apply.
Measured on seed 42 (per-order median incision, m; want S1 small, trunks 200–400 m):

- pure SP: S1=380 S2=366 S3=286 **S4=138** — inverted (headwaters carve most).
- incision threshold `θ` (`E=K·max(0,A^m·S^n−θ)`): a razor window — θ=0.02 drops S1 to
  39 m but collapses trunks (S4=11); θ≥0.05 kills all. Does NOT fix it.
- critical area `A_c` (hillslope below, fluvial above): monotone only at an
  implausibly sparse 400 km² channel head, trunks then ~100 m. Does NOT fix it alone.
- **coupled regime split** (diffusion on hillslopes `A<A_c` + stream power on channels
  `A≥A_c`, interleaved) — TASK 3 WAS needed and it WORKS: at A_c=50 cells, D=0.05,
  **S1 → 30 m** (headwaters fixed) and the valley cross-section OPENS from 250 m
  (SP-only) to **420 m** (V-walls; drainage relief 659 m). Residual: mid-order still
  out-incises trunks (S2=338 > S4=115) — physically defensible (tributaries drop into
  graded trunks), not the headwater pathology.

**Legibility over "minimal steep land" (criterion change — see Decision summary).**
Judged on spatial structure (valley floor / cliff sharpness / flank contiguity),
UNCOUPLED is the more legible: at K=3, cf=1.0, 1024²/400 km — trunk valley W/D ≈ 8.8
(≈ the 2 km/300 m target), channel flanks 27° vs interfluves 10° (steep concentrated on
flanks, not plateaux), largest contiguous flank 4677 cells, ~690 km² buildable floor.
Coupling (cf=0.39) is TOO FLAT (W/D 38, 13° flanks). So do NOT couple depth_scale to
domain. **Droplets are corrosive at ANY density**: SP relief 659 m → SP+weak
(0.25/cell) 124 m → SP+full 68 m — recommend droplets ≈ off (hillslope diffusion + FBM
base supply texture).

**A_c must be in km², not cells (8192² finding).** `min_area_cells` = 50 cells is
7.6 km² at 1024² (removes headwaters) but only 0.12 km² at 8192², so at production
resolution headwaters became "channels" again and over-carved (S1 25 → 680 m). The
channel-head criterion MUST be a physical area (≈ 7.6 km²), converted to cells per
resolution. With that fix, incision is resolution-stable.

**Recommended (implementation pass, NOT wired):** stream-power ON, K=3, m=0.5, n=1,
iterations=3, sea_level=0.5, **A_c ≈ 7.6 km² (converted to cells per resolution),
diffusion ≈ 0.05 (regime split)**, θ=0, droplets ≈ off, **UNCOUPLED** vertical scale.
8192² confirmation (author seed 10481999410520546993, A_c=7.6 km²=3188 cells, uncoupled):
FBM 1.3 s, stream-power 33 s, peak RSS 3.9 GB; **headwaters fixed (S1=0), ordering
concave (S2=646 S3=377 S4=240 S5=179)**, cliff transition 49 m (sharp), 42 855 hex of
<5° floor. Two refinements for the NEXT pass: (i) trunk channels incise as narrow deep
SLOTS (W/D ≈ 0.5, 98 m wide / 178 m deep) rather than wide buildable valleys — likely
needs a lower A_c and/or stronger hillslope diffusion to widen trunk floors; (ii)
incision is ~1.5× higher at 8192² than 1024² (S4 136→240) — K wants a mild
per-resolution re-anchor. Whether the pervasive steep flanks (largest component 1.07 M
cells) read as "legible" or "over-incised" is now an author visual call.

## Finding 5 — FBM shrinks to a symmetry-breaking seed; width widens downstream; incision is resolution-dependent

**The reframe (why this is possible now).** 64² → 8192² is 128× per axis, so pure
interpolation gives a featureless surface (the bilinear baseline). Detail must be
either INVENTED (FBM) or DERIVED (erosion physics). Until stream-power, FBM had to
carry the detail because droplets destroyed relief; now that stream-power CREATES
relief causally, FBM can shrink from "terrain generator" to "symmetry-breaking seed"
— just enough initial irregularity for drainage to organise.

**Measured (1024², relief-v1 incision on each FBM variant).**
- **Amplitude is reducible ≥8× with drainage fully organic.** `amplitude_base`
  0.16→0.02: FBM roughness 0.031→0.024, and maxStrahler (4–5), confluences (~680),
  segments (~3140), valley floor (~680 km²) ALL stay healthy — the degeneracy floor
  is BELOW 0.02, not reached. So a low-amplitude seed (≈0.02–0.04) keeps organic
  drainage. Recommend that regime; confirm the visual striation drop by eye.
- **The anisotropy knobs do NOT move the striation metric.** `max_anisotropy` 3→1
  (isotropic), `amplitude_slope_factor` 3→0, `octaves` 7→3 all leave the
  roughness-asymmetry (grad vs contour, ±8 cells) at ~0.83 (pre-incision ~0.80).
  Either the visual striations are not controlled by these knobs, or the ±8-cell
  asymmetry metric is too coarse to isolate them — an honest gap; amplitude_base is
  the lever that demonstrably reduces overall FBM detail (and shifts the metric:
  pre-FBM asym 0.80→0.69, λ 8.8→11.5 cells as amplitude falls).

**Width is a healthy DISTRIBUTION, not a slot (corrects the 8192² single-channel
read).** W/D per Strahler order (1024²): S1 median 2.7 (headwater gorges), S2 4.1,
S3 8.8, S4 41.4 (wide trunks), with a fat tail (p90 up to 77). **W/D widens
downstream** — gorges as chokepoint content upstream, wide buildable valleys at
trunks/coast. No widening fix needed.

**Incision is resolution-dependent — and physical units DON'T fix it (measured).**
Per-order incision rises with resolution (S4: 108 m @512² → 136 @1024² → 318 @2048²).
The physical reformulation (`A` in km², `S = Δh_m / dist_m`) was IMPLEMENTED and
measured: for the shipped `n=1, m=0.5` it is **algebraically equivalent** to the
normalised law (the `cell_km` factor cancels between `A_km²^0.5` and `dist_m`), so
`K = 3000` physical reproduces the reference EXACTLY (relief 682 m, S1=25 S2=414
S3=307 S4=136 — identical to normalised K=3) and the resolution dependence is
**UNCHANGED** (still 108/136/318). So the ~1.5× drift is NOT a slope-unit artifact —
it originates in the FBM detail resolving sharper gradients on finer cells. The real
levers are a resolution-independent FBM feature size or an explicit per-resolution K;
the physical law is kept because it makes K dimensional and matters for `n≠1`, but it
is a no-op for the shipped exponents. (Corrects the earlier "physical slope is the
clean fix" hypothesis.)

**Striations (TASK 2 metric) — the anisotropy knob is not the lever.** A directional
power-spectrum metric (length-48 profiles along contour vs gradient on steep cells)
does NOT respond to `max_anisotropy` 3→1 (ratio ~0.65 either way, no short-λ peak) —
same verdict as the ±8 roughness metric. Either the visual striations are not
gradient/contour-aligned or not from `max_anisotropy`. `amplitude_base` is the lever
that moves both metrics (ratio 0.65→0.45 at 0.04) and reduces overall FBM detail 8×
with drainage staying organic (Finding 5 above); the rendered amplitude ladder
(exports/relief_ladder/, 0.16/0.08/0.04/0.02) is the visual arbiter, provisional
recommendation `amplitude_base ≈ 0.04`.

## Finding 4 — Terraces are an EROSION-DEPOSITION artifact, NOT a tectonic/isostasy closure

**Context.** The relief shows terraces PARALLEL to contours (concentric loops around
hills), with jumps of several hundred metres. The initial hypothesis (recorded here
because it was tested) was a coarse discrete altitude level from the C1
equilibrium-height closure (a single global `h_eq` → level sets).

**Measurement (seed 42 coarse field — the hypothesis was REFUTED).**
- u16 quantisation REFUTED: 0.1–0.14 m/unit, vs observed jumps of 100s of m.
- equilibrium-height clamp INACTIVE: **0 %** of `S̃` cells sit at `h_eq = 2.0`
  (only 1 % are even above it; `S̃` maxes at 2.18). Davis-Suppe `h_max = 2.5`: **0 %**
  (and its cap is distance-TAPERED `h_max·(1−exp(−d/L))`, already spatially varying).
- cratonic isostasy is NOT a level either: cratonic land altitude p10/median/p90 =
  335 / 1072 / 1901 m — a WIDE band, not a step.
- No clean discrete altitude ladder on the coarse land field.
- Terrace-source disentangle (flat fraction of a transect): **pure bilinear
  (coarse only) 13 % → FBM 6 % → after erosion 24 %.** FBM ROUGHENS; the flat fraction
  is dominated by **erosion DEPOSITION** (6 % → 24 %).

**Conclusion (corrected).** The terraces are NOT produced by a coarse
tectonic/isostasy closure — the equilibrium-height / Davis-Suppe / craton candidates
are all refuted by direct measurement. They are an **erosion-deposition artifact**:
the same net-zero, uncorrelated-droplet erosion of Finding 3 deposits sediment in
flat sheets that pool to local base levels bounded by contours (hence "concentric
terraces"). Terraces and missing valleys are TWO SYMPTOMS OF ONE CAUSE — the erosion
algorithm (Finding 3), not two separate jobs.

**Caveats.** Measured on seed 42; the earlier "~120–176 m resolution-independent
step" came from a weak modal-|Δ| metric and is not a confirmed discrete ladder. A
client-side render contribution (contouring/quantisation in Living Landz) is not
excluded and is out of Ymir's scope. The coastal `coastal_deposit_fraction` sink
reduces COASTAL deposition, not the inland depositional flats.

**Decision.** Fold the terrace fix into the erosion chantier (Finding 3's routed
stream-power successor + a deposition/transport rework), not into the isostasy /
equilibrium-height closures. Not touched here.

**Consequences.** The prior "address terraces at the isostasy source, before
stream-power" ordering is moot — both are the erosion chantier. When any tectonic
closure IS eventually touched, re-check the pre-existing Picard non-convergence in
that layer — [docs/issues/picard-nonconvergence-rectangular-smoke.md](../issues/picard-nonconvergence-rectangular-smoke.md).
